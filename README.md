# Stay Calm
> Game protoype to keep your character calm as the panic builds.
This is one of my first solo game development projects. This was to help teach me how to build a first person experience during moments of panic. This includes delayed movement and adjusting visuals such as widened peripherial and blurred vision. This utilizes line tracing for determing peripherial vision and direct sight.
